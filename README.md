# RIO
*Registered Input Output*  
Platform and standard for class object management and connectivity by creating a virtual environment, focused on both end-user experience and standard modularity for developers.  
The initial version of this project will focus on a virtual microcontroller module (the RIOvmc), other basic IO modules to test functionailty, and a sample environment to run it all in.

## Project Outline
### What are we trying to do?

1. Create an easy to use standard for developers to create class objects (modules) that can talk to each other, and the virtual environment in which the inhabbit (the outside world)
2. Utilizing this standard, create a tool that will allow users pick the modules they want, and connect them how they wish, and run it in a virtual environment.

## (To be developed) Included Module Descriptions
### RIOvmc
A simulated microcontroller that will run an extended version of the LC3 assembly language compiled into a custom binary format. The primary focus of this module is to have a flexable platform to test functionailty of the rest of the modules
