# RIO
*Registered Input Output*  
Platform and standard for class object management and connectivity by creating a virtual environment, focused on both end-user expereince and standard modularity for developers.  
The initial version of this will focus on a virtual microcontroller of sorts (the RIOvmc), along with other basic IO modules to test functionailty

## Project Outline
### What are we trying to do?
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61638976/113528054-758c7a00-958d-11eb-9e4f-4e50887cf7b7.png)
### How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
### What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
### Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?
### What are the risks?
### ~~How much will it cost?~~
### ~~How long will it take?~~
*As long as it needs to take*
### What are the mid-term and final “exams” to check for success?

## What are 'Modules', how do they work together, what is the standard for development

## (To be developed) Included Module Descriptions
### RIOvmc
A simulated microcontroller that will run an extended version of the LC3 assembly language compiled into a custom binary format. The primary focus of this module is to have a flexable platform to test functionailty of the rest of the modules
